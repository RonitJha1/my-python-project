# TUPLE OPERATIONS
# a=(1,2,3)
# b=(4,5,6)
# c=a+b
# print(c)

# Repetition: You can repeat a tuple using the * operator.
# a=(1,2,3,4)
# b=(a*3)
# print(b)
# Checking Membership: You can check if an element exists in a tuple using the in keyword.
# a=("Ronit","ram","hari")
# print("Ronit"in a)
# print("ro"in a)

#
# TUPLE METHODS
# Tuples have two built-in methods: count() and index().
# • count(x): Returns the number of times x appears in the tuple.
# • index(x): Returns the index of the first occurrence of x in the tuple.
# a=(1,2,3,4,5,6,2,7,8,9)
# print(a.count(2))
# print(a.index(6))
